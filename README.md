HOTSPoT is a semantic segmentation tool based on **Segformer**, designed to automatically identify **portal tracts** in Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)-stained liver biopsies.  
It can be used both as a **pre-processing module** for downstream tasks (e.g., analysis on portal-only regions) and as an **annotation assistant** in spatial tissue experiments.

## üß™ Methods

![COVER](https://github.com/Gizmopath/HOTSPoT/blob/main/images/study.jpg)

- Whole Slide Images (WSIs) collected from liver pathology reference institutions.
- WSIs were anonymized and digitized using various scanners.
- Portal tracts manually annotated by expert hepatopathologists.
- 256√ó256 pixel tiles extracted from annotated regions at 1Œºm/px resolution.
- Fine-tuning performed on the [pretrained SegformerB0 model](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/segformer-b0-finetuned-ade-512-512).
